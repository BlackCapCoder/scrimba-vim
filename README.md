# Scrimba Vim
Control [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) with Vim!


This is currently a work in progress. You can see video of it in action [here](https://youtu.be/EHFpQirzt18)

### Installation

Install it with your favorite package manager, I recommend Dein:

    call dein#add('BlackCapCoder/scrimba-vim')

You also need to add `userscript.js` to Tampermonkey in Chome.
